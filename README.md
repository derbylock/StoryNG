The idea of the project is to create the new story-focused game engine. It should be as simple as Twine but with some additional features. Some features are:

- Auto generation for emotion and animation metainformation for characters' speech lines.
- Paraphrasing text sentences.
- Simple media integration for stories. 
- Character stats system
- Character inventory system
- Events simulation
- Story abstraction could be presented in other game engines ( basic presentation engines are: html-text, html-2d-topdown, ue-topdown, ue-3rdperson, ue-firstperson, html-2d-vn, renpy-2d-vn, linux-*, windows-*)
- Neural networks integration for images and text geneaption
- Human readable story format
