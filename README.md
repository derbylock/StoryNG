# StoryNG
The new generation story-oriented game engine

[[_TOC_]]

# Overview


The idea of the project is to create the new story-focused game engine. It should be as simple as Twine but with some additional features. Some features are:

- Auto generation for emotion and animation metainformation for characters' speech lines.
- Paraphrasing text sentences.
- Simple media integration for stories. 
- Character stats system
- Character inventory system
- Save/load system
- Events simulation
- Story abstraction could be presented in other game engines ( basic presentation engines are: html-text, html-2d-topdown, ue-topdown, ue-3rdperson, ue-firstperson, html-2d-vn, renpy-2d-vn, linux-*, windows-*)
- Neural networks integration for images and text geneaption
- Human readable story format

# Concepts
The story could be played at any time. The story is created from top to down. Firstly, you write simple text. Then you add more and more details, presentations, simulations, etc. iteratively

# Terms
